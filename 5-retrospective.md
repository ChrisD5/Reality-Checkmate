Creating "Reality Check-Mate" was a profound experience. My initial objective was to build a self-improvement app that tackled the challenge of inflated egos, and despite hurdles, I believe I accomplished that goal.

A significant test was integrating the Google Maps API for the Therapist Locator feature. It involved grasping location permissions and the API's intricacies, which required a considerable time investment. However, I adapted by setting aside additional time to fully comprehend and correctly implement the feature.

If I were to revisit this project, I would incorporate more in-depth features such as the incorporation of a streaks system for the daily activities. This would not only add a layer of complexity to the app but also increase user engagement and bolster the process of ego reduction.

Additionally, I'd develop a community forum for users to anonymously share their personal growth stories and integrate user accounts for a personalized experience. I'd also consider transforming the "Ego Crush" game into a chess-based format, which would require substantial time due to the complexities of chess algorithms but would align more closely with the app's theme.

In retrospect, this journey was a valuable lesson in perseverance, adaptability, and strategic planning, significantly enriching my Android development skills and problem-solving abilities.
