My proposed application, "Reality Check-mate," (a play on words of reality check and check mate) aims to help individuals reduce their egos, a growing issue in our society often leading to personal and social conflicts. This comprehensive ego-management tool will offer a suite of interactive features, from daily humbling notifications and activities to progress tracking journals. Users can even customize their experience by creating personalized notifications.

One unique aspect is a specially designed unwinnable game, subtly demonstrating the concept of humility. A quiz component also allows users to assess their ego levels over time, fostering self-awareness and personal growth. In addition, the app connects users to local therapists, providing professional assistance when necessary.

I've chosen to develop RCM as I believe it fills a gap in the market, addressing an often-overlooked aspect of mental health. It promotes humility and empathy, vital yet often neglected traits in our increasingly competitive society. RCM will be useful to anyone seeking personal growth and better social interaction. It's worth building because it not only helps individuals manage their ego but also contributes to cultivating a more empathetic and understanding society.
